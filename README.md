# Underwater Robot

A RobotC code to program an underwater robot prototype. This code is part of the project to create an Autonomous Underwater Cable-Running robot (ENGR 120 - Design and Communication II @ UVic). 

The program instructs robot to move towards the target withstanding all the obstructions and going around them. It uses different numerical value according to the construction of my team's robot (the values can be different for other robots built for a similar task).
